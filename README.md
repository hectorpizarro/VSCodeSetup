Visual Studio code Setup This repository stores the VS Code setup used on my
last projects. The idea was shamelessly stolen from Kent C Dodds
(https://kentcdodds.com/uses):

- .eslintrc.js: Eslint config file.
- .gitignore: Git ignore, modified from the one generated with create-react-app.
- .prettierrc.js: Prettier config file.
- captureCodeExtensions.js: Script to print a list of VSCode installed
  extensions.
- express-server.js: Express setup, used for projects that include Express and a
  React webapp.
- package.json: Package json from last project, includes all packages for Eslint
  and Prettier.
- Procfile: Used for Express server.
- settings.json: VS Code setup.
- vscode-extensions.txt: List of VS Code extensions to install.
